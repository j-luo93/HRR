what <B> we <B> want <B> to <I> do <I> is <B> take <I> a <B> more <I> aggressive <I> stance <I>
people <B> did <B> n't <I> believe <I> we <B> were <B> in <B> tune <B> with <B> the <B> marketplace <I> and <O> in <B> many <B> ways <I> we <B> were <B> n't <O>
the <B> <unk> <O> magazine <B> has <B> never <I> had <I> to <I> woo <I> advertisers <B> with <B> quite <B> so <I> much <I> <unk> <O> before <B>

but <O> this <B> year <I> when <B> the <B> <unk> <O> surrounding <B> its <B> centennial <I> died <B> so <B> too <I> did <B> some <B> advertiser <I> interest <I>
the <B> reason <I> ad <I> executives <I> say <B> is <B> that <B> the <B> entire <I> magazine <I> business <I> has <B> been <I> soft <B> and <O> national <B> geographic <I> has <B> some <B> <unk> <O> that <B> make <B> it <B> especially <B> <unk> <O> during <B> a <B> soft <I> market <I>
perhaps <B> the <B> biggest <I> of <B> those <B> factors <I> is <B> its <B> high <I> ad <I> prices <B> $ <B> N <I> for <B> a <B> <unk> <O> page <B> vs. <O> $ <B> N <I> for <B> the <B> <unk> <O> a <B> comparable <I> publication <I> with <B> a <B> far <I> smaller <I> circulation <I>
when <B> ad <B> dollars <I> are <B> tight <B> the <B> high <I> page <I> cost <I> is <B> a <B> major <I> <unk> <O> for <B> advertisers <B> who <B> generally <B> want <B> to <I> appear <I> regularly <B> in <B> a <B> publication <I> or <O> not <B> at <I> all <B>
even <B> though <I> national <B> geographic <I> offers <I> far <B> more <B> readers <I> than <B> does <O> a <B> magazine <I> like <B> <unk> <O> the <B> page <I> costs <B> you <B> an <B> arm <I> and <O> a <B> leg <I> to <B> develop <I> any <B> frequency <I> says <B> harry <B> glass <I> new <B> york <I> media <I> manager <I> for <B> bozell <B> inc <I>
to <B> combat <I> that <B> problem <B> national <I> geographic <I> like <B> other <B> magazines <I> began <B> offering <I> regional <B> editions <I> allowing <B> advertisers <B> to <B> appear <I> in <B> only <B> a <I> portion <I> of <B> its <B> magazines <I> for <B> example <B> ads <I> can <B> run <I> only <B> in <I> the <B> magazines <I> sent <B> to <B> subscribers <B> in <B> the <B> largest <I> N <I> markets <I>
but <O> the <B> magazine <I> was <B> slower <B> than <B> its <B> competitors <I> to <B> come <I> up <B> with <B> its <B> regional <I> editions <I> and <O> until <B> last <B> year <I> offered <B> fewer <B> of <B> them <B> than <B> did <O> competitors <B>

another <B> sticking <I> point <I> for <B> advertisers <B> was <B> national <B> geographic <I> 's <B> tradition <I> of <B> <unk> <O> its <B> ads <I> together <B> usually <I> at <B> the <B> beginning <I> or <I> end <I> of <B> the <B> magazine <I> rather <B> than <I> spreading <B> ads <B> out <B> among <B> its <B> articles <I> as <B> most <B> magazines <I> do <B>

when <B> the <B> shah <I> died <B> president <B> carter <I> was <B> so <B> scared <I> that <B> the <B> shah <I> 's <B> ghost <I> would <B> blame <I> him <B> for <B> <unk> <O> him <B> out <B> to <B> make <I> way <B> for <B> the <B> <unk> <O> that <B> he <B> declared <B> the <B> carter <I> doctrine <I>

but <O> that <B> ghost <I> would <B> n't <I> settle <I> for <B> words <B> he <B> wanted <B> money <B> and <I> people <I> lots <I>

it <B> made <B> my <B> <unk> <O> dance <B> with <B> <unk> <O>
why <B> he <B> used <B> to <I> lay <I> in <B> wait <B> for <B> cap <B> suddenly <B> he <B> 'd <B> leap <I> from <B> behind <B> some <B> <unk> <O> of <B> marshall <B> onto <B> cap <B> 's <B> <unk> <O> and <O> grab <B> him <B> by <B> the <B> <unk> <O> and <O> <unk> <O> him <B> till <B> he <B> <unk> <B> up <B> an <B> additional <I> $ <I> N <I> billion <I> or <I> so <I>
cap <B> added <B> four <B> more <I> divisions <I> to <B> the <B> army <I> two <B> active <I> and <O> two <B> reserve <I> two <B> carrier <I> groups <I> to <B> the <B> navy <I> a <B> division <I> equivalent <B> to <B> the <B> <unk> <O> and <O> the <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> and <O> a <B> thousand <I> tactical <I> aircraft <I> to <B> the <B> air <I> force <I>

one <B> night <I> both <B> marshall <I> 's <B> ghost <I> and <O> the <B> shah <I> 's <B> ghost <I> together <B> caught <B> cap <B> and <O> threw <B> him <B> to <B> the <B> ground <I>
before <B> they <B> let <B> him <B> go <B> he <B> added <B> a <B> thousand <I> bureaucrats <I> to <B> the <B> <unk> <O> in <B> tampa <B> and <O> renamed <B> it <B> central <B> command <I>
he <B> gave <B> those <B> bureaucrats <I> charge <B> of <B> all <B> naval <I> operations <I> in <B> the <B> persian <I> gulf <I> and <I> indian <I> ocean <I>
marshall <B> figured <B> it <B> would <B> be <I> good <B> training <I> for <B> those <B> soldiers <I> someday <B> maybe <B> they <B> would <B> get <I> the <B> whole <I> navy <I>
they <B> had <B> fun <B> moving <B> the <B> carriers <I> around <B> but <O> it <B> turned <B> out <B> that <B> they <B> had <B> forgotten <I> all <B> about <B> mine <B> <unk> <O>
but <O> the <B> shah <I> still <B> kept <B> leaping <I> out <B> at <B> cap <B> so <B> cap <I> bought <B> a <B> hundred <I> merchant <I> ships <I> more <I> and <O> $ <B> N <I> billion <I> of <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> etc. <B> in <B> order <I> that <I> those <B> seven <I> new <I> army <I> divisions <I> and <O> three <B> marine <I> <unk> <O> could <B> unload <I> from <B> all <B> those <I> new <I> ships <I> and <I> aircraft <I> and <O> go <B> to <B> war <B> in <B> the <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O>
then <B> suddenly <I> <unk> <O> 's <B> ghost <I> came <B> to <I> visit <I> and <O> said <B> what <B> the <B> hell <I> are <O> you <B> doing <B> planning <B> for <B> a <B> land <I> war <I> in <B> asia <B> N <I> miles <I> away <B>
we <B> 'd <B> get <I> our <B> <unk> <O> kicked <B>
lucky <B> for <B> cap <B> <unk> <O> was <B> <unk> <O> and <O> soon <B> went <I> away <B> while <B> the <B> shah <I> he <B> kept <B> coming <I> back <B>
so <O> the <B> u.s. <O> found <B> itself <B> paying <B> about <B> $ <I> N <I> billion <I> in <B> <unk> <O> to <B> various <B> arab <I> <unk> <O> for <B> <unk> <O> rights <B> around <B> the <B> indian <I> ocean <I>

still <B> <unk> <O> was <B> the <B> best <I> we <B> could <B> get <I> so <B> we <B> stay <B> in <B> bed <B> with <B> president <B> <unk> <O>
all <B> these <I> reports <I> about <B> him <B> committing <B> <unk> <O> are <B> probably <B> <unk> <O> anyway <B>

centrust <B> did <B> n't <I> meet <I> the <B> deadline <I>
the <B> collection <I> was <B> at <B> the <B> heart <I> of <B> a <B> <unk> <O> plan <B> mr. <I> paul <I> had <B> in <B> which <B> the <B> art <I> was <B> to <I> do <I> double <B> duty <I> as <B> an <B> investment <I> for <B> centrust <B> and <O> as <B> <unk> <O> for <B> the <B> s&l <I> 's <B> new <I> office <I> tower <I> designed <B> by <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O>
the <B> <unk> <O> is <B> that <B> the <B> $ <I> N <I> million <I> was <B> <unk> <O> from <B> the <B> funds <I> of <B> this <B> federally <I> insured <I> institution <I> even <B> as <I> centrust <B> was <B> losing <I> money <B> hand <I> over <B> <unk> <O>
mr. <B> paul <I> had <B> no <B> right <I> to <B> buy <I> art <B> for <B> the <B> s&l <I> in <B> the <B> first <I> place <I> it <B> is <B> n't <O> on <B> the <B> comptroller <I> 's <B> permissible <I> list <I> without <B> seeking <B> a <B> special <I> <unk> <O> which <B> he <B> did <B> not <I> do <I>
besides <B> that <B> some <B> of <B> the <B> paintings <I> that <B> were <B> to <I> grace <I> the <B> walls <I> of <B> centrust <B> actually <B> ended <B> up <B> hanging <B> in <B> the <B> chairman <I> 's <B> estate <I> on <B> la <I> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> off <B> miami <B> beach <I>
