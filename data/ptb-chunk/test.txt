these <B> critics <I> fail <B> to <I> <unk> <I> between <B> the <B> type <I> of <B> ethnic <B> humor <I> that <B> aims <B> at <B> <unk> <O> another <B> group <I> such <B> as <I> polish <B> jokes <I> and <O> the <B> type <I> that <B> is <B> <unk> <O> aiming <B> <unk> <O> as <B> well <I> as <I> <unk> <O>
the <B> latter <I> typically <B> is <B> the <B> humor <I> of <B> the <B> <unk> <O> and <O> it <B> was <B> <unk> <O> by <B> both <B> blacks <I> and <I> <unk> <O> on <B> the <B> <unk> <O> and <O> <unk> <O> stage <B> as <B> a <B> means <I> of <B> <unk> <O> their <B> white <I> and <I> <unk> <O> audiences <B> along <B> with <I> themselves <B>
in <B> the <B> hands <I> of <B> a <B> <unk> <O> like <B> <unk> <O> bruce <B> this <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> could <B> cut <I> both <B> the <B> <unk> <O> and <O> the <B> audience <I> to <B> <unk> <O>

why <B> <unk> <O>
because <B> despite <B> all <B> the <I> media <I> <unk> <O> about <B> comedy <B> and <I> politics <I> not <B> <unk> <O> they <B> are <B> similar <B> in <B> one <B> respect <I> both <O> can <B> serve <I> as <B> <unk> <O> for <B> easing <B> <unk> <O> and <O> <unk> <O> the <B> <unk> <O> of <B> groups <B> in <B> conflict <B>
that <B> 's <B> why <B> it <B> 's <B> dangerous <B> to <B> have <I> <unk> <O> thought <B> police <B> on <B> college <B> <unk> <O> and <O> elsewhere <B> <unk> <O> all <B> critical <I> mention <I> of <B> group <B> differences <I>
as <B> elizabeth <B> <unk> <O> wrote <B> in <B> the <B> new <I> york <I> times <I> just <B> before <B> the <B> mason <I> <unk> <O> perhaps <B> <unk> <O> would <B> not <I> <unk> <O> over <B> with <B> such <B> intensity <I> if <B> honest <B> differences <I> were <B> allowed <I> to <I> <unk> <O>
the <B> question <I> is <B> if <B> group <B> conflicts <I> still <B> exist <B> as <B> <unk> <O> they <B> do <B> and <O> if <B> mr. <B> mason <I> 's <B> type <I> of <B> ethnic <B> humor <I> is <B> <unk> <O> then <B> what <B> other <B> means <I> do <O> we <B> have <B> for <B> letting <B> off <B> steam <B>

it <B> is <B> true <B> that <B> the <B> best <I> <unk> <O> do <B> allow <I> group <B> differences <I> to <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> vs. <B> blue-collar <B> <unk> <O> in <B> <unk> <O> children <B> vs. <B> adults <B> in <B> the <B> cosby <I> show <I>

it <B> could <B> n't <I> be <I> more <B> obvious <I> that <B> chicken <B> soup <I> is <B> being <I> made <I> from <B> an <B> old <I> <unk> <O>

back <B> in <B> the <B> 1920s <I> the <B> play <I> and <I> movie <I> versions <I> of <B> <unk> <O> 's <B> irish <I> rose <B> made <I> the <B> theme <I> of <B> <unk> <O> between <B> the <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> of <B> jewish <B> and <I> irish <I> <unk> <O> so <B> popular <I> that <B> its <B> author <I> anne <I> <unk> <O> lost <B> a <B> <unk> <O> suit <B> on <B> the <B> grounds <I> that <B> the <B> plot <I> has <B> entered <I> the <B> public <I> <unk> <O>

for <B> instance <B> michael <I> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> not <O> because <B> he <B> 's <B> a <B> <unk> <O> jewish <B> businessman <I> but <O> because <B> he <B> <unk> <B> his <B> <unk> <O> job <B> as <B> a <B> salesman <I> in <B> order <O> to <B> become <I> a <B> social <I> worker <I>
even <B> more <I> <unk> <O> is <B> the <B> <unk> <O> between <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> and <O> mr. <B> mason <I> 's <B> comic <I> <unk> <O>
the <B> best <I> moments <I> in <B> the <B> show <I> occur <B> at <B> the <B> beginning <I> and <O> the <B> end <I> and <O> occasionally <B> in <B> the <B> middle <I> when <B> mr. <B> mason <I> <unk> <O> into <B> his <B> <unk> <O> mode <B> and <O> starts <B> <unk> <O> out <B> that <B> old-fashioned <I> jewish <I> <unk> <O> to <B> other <B> people <I> as <B> well <I> as <I> to <B> himself <B>

no <B> to <B> my <B> mind <I> the <B> journal <I> did <B> not <I> defend <I> <unk> <O> fraud <B> waste <I> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> and <B> abuse <I> of <B> the <B> public <I> trust <I>
it <B> defended <B> appropriate <B> constitutional <I> <unk> <O> and <B> practical <I> common <I> sense <I>
the <B> problem <I> which <B> the <B> journal <I> so <B> <unk> <O> pointed <B> out <B> in <B> a <B> number <I> of <B> articles <B> is <B> not <O> the <B> likes <I> of <B> mr. <B> <unk> <O> who <B> after <B> all <B> is <B> really <B> a <B> bit <I> player <I> on <B> the <B> stage <I> but <O> the <B> attempt <I> by <B> congress <B> to <B> enhance <I> itself <B> into <B> a <B> <unk> <O> body <B>

raymond <B> <unk> <O>

i <B> disagree <B> with <B> the <B> statement <I> by <B> mr. <B> <unk> <O> that <B> one <B> should <B> not <I> draw <I> an <B> adverse <I> <unk> <O> against <B> former <B> hud <I> officials <I> who <B> <unk> <B> their <B> fifth <I> amendment <I> privilege <I> against <B> <unk> <O> in <B> congressional <B> hearings <I>
the <B> fifth <I> amendment <I> states <I> in <B> relevant <B> part <I> that <B> no <B> person <I> shall <B> be <I> <unk> <O> in <B> any <B> criminal <I> case <I> to <B> be <I> a <B> witness <I> against <B> himself <B>
this <B> privilege <I> against <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> the <B> drawing <I> of <B> an <B> adverse <I> <unk> <O> against <B> a <B> criminal <I> defendant <I> who <B> chooses <B> not <O> to <B> testify <I>
thus <B> in <B> a <B> criminal <I> case <I> a <B> prosecutor <I> can <B> not <I> comment <I> on <B> a <B> defendant <I> 's <B> failure <I> to <B> testify <I> nor <O> can <O> the <B> defendant <I> be <B> <unk> <O> to <B> take <I> the <B> stand <I> as <B> a <B> witness <I> thus <B> forcing <B> him <B> to <B> take <I> the <B> fifth <I>
the <B> privilege <I> however <B> has <B> been <I> limited <I> in <B> <unk> <O> with <B> its <B> plain <I> language <I> to <B> protect <I> the <B> defendant <I> in <B> criminal <B> matters <I> only <I>
the <B> supreme <I> court <I> and <O> some <B> states <I> have <B> specifically <I> recognized <I> that <B> the <B> fifth <I> amendment <I> does <B> not <I> preclude <I> the <B> <unk> <O> where <B> the <B> privilege <I> is <B> claimed <I> by <B> a <B> party <I> to <B> a <B> civil <I> cause <I>

thus <B> in <B> a <B> civil <I> case <I> a <B> defendant <I> may <B> be <I> called <I> as <B> a <B> witness <I> he <B> may <B> be <I> forced <I> to <I> testify <I> or <I> take <I> the <B> fifth <I> and <O> his <B> taking <I> of <B> the <B> fifth <I> may <B> permit <I> the <B> drawing <I> of <B> an <B> adverse <I> <unk> <O> against <B> him <B> in <B> the <B> civil <I> matter <I>

allowing <B> the <B> defendant <I> to <B> take <I> the <B> fifth <I> in <B> a <B> civil <I> matter <I> is <B> not <B> based <I> on <B> a <B> constitutional <I> right <I> to <B> refuse <I> to <I> testify <I> where <B> one <B> 's <B> testimony <I> <unk> <O> him <B> in <B> the <B> civil <I> matter <I> but <O> because <B> the <B> testimony <I> in <B> the <B> civil <I> matter <I> could <B> be <I> <unk> <O> used <B> against <B> him <B> in <B> a <B> subsequent <I> criminal <I> prosecution <I>

thus <B> when <B> mr. <I> <unk> <O> asserted <B> the <B> fifth <I> in <B> a <B> <unk> <O> proceeding <B> particularly <B> after <B> presumably <B> receiving <B> extensive <B> advice <I> from <B> legal <B> counsel <I> one <B> must <B> conclude <I> that <B> he <B> held <B> a <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> belief <B> that <B> his <B> testimony <I> could <B> be <I> used <I> against <B> him <B> in <B> a <B> subsequent <I> criminal <I> prosecution <I>
the <B> subcommittee <I> congress <I> and <O> the <B> american <I> public <I> have <B> every <B> right <I> to <B> draw <I> the <B> adverse <I> <unk> <O> and <O> to <B> <unk> <I> with <B> mr. <B> <unk> <O> 's <B> own <I> belief <I> that <B> his <B> testimony <I> could <B> help <I> <unk> <O> him <B> of <B> a <B> crime <I>

some <B> analysts <I> say <B> uncertainty <B> about <B> washington <B> 's <B> anti-takeover <I> policy <I> was <B> one <B> reason <I> that <B> financing <B> for <B> the <B> united <I> airlines <I> takeover <I> fell <B> through <B> the <B> event <I> that <B> triggered <B> the <B> market <I> drop <I>
in <B> many <B> ways <I> the <B> backdrop <I> to <B> friday <I> 's <B> stock <I> decline <I> is <B> <unk> <O> similar <B> to <B> that <B> of <B> october <B> N <I> 's <B> <unk> <O> crash <B>

lawmakers <B> and <O> administration <B> officials <I> agree <B> that <B> friday <B> 's <B> drop <I> by <B> itself <B> is <B> n't <O> enough <B> to <B> force <I> both <B> sides <I> back <B> to <B> the <B> table <I> to <B> try <I> to <I> reach <I> a <B> deficit-reduction <I> agreement <I> that <B> would <B> be <I> more <B> serious <I> and <O> more <B> far-reaching <I> than <B> last <B> spring <I> 's <B> <unk> <O> plan <B> which <B> still <B> is <B> n't <I> fully <I> implemented <I>
one <B> of <B> the <B> biggest <I> reasons <I> that <B> new <B> talks <I> are <B> n't <O> likely <B> to <B> come <I> about <B> is <B> that <B> as <B> everyone <B> learned <B> in <B> N <B> the <B> economy <I> and <O> the <B> market <I> can <B> survive <I> a <B> one-day <I> <unk> <O> tumble <B>

in <B> that <B> case <I> there <B> will <B> be <I> plenty <B> of <B> blame <B> to <B> go <I> around <B>
there <B> is <B> an <B> underlying <I> concern <I> on <B> the <B> part <I> of <B> the <B> american <I> people <I> and <O> there <B> should <B> be <I> that <B> the <B> administration <I> has <B> not <I> gone <I> far <B> enough <I> in <B> cutting <B> this <B> deficit <I> and <O> that <B> congress <I> has <B> been <I> unwilling <B> to <B> cut <I> what <B> the <B> administration <I> asked <B> us <B> to <B> cut <I> said <B> senate <B> finance <I> committee <I> chairman <I> lloyd <I> <unk> <O> d. <B> texas <I>
nevertheless <B> it <B> clearly <B> will <B> take <I> more <B> than <B> friday <B> 's <B> 190-point <I> decline <I> to <B> overcome <I> the <B> bitter <I> feelings <I> that <B> have <B> developed <I> between <B> lawmakers <B> and <O> white <B> house <I> budget <I> director <I> richard <I> darman <I> over <B> the <B> capital-gains <I> fight <I>

first <B> came <B> his <B> predictable <I> <unk> <O> he <B> charged <B> the <B> coalition <I> of <B> the <B> left <I> and <I> progress <I> had <B> sold <I> out <B> its <B> leftist <I> <unk> <O> by <B> <unk> <O> in <B> a <B> <unk> <O> plot <B> aimed <B> at <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> and <O> <unk> <O> the <B> course <I> of <B> socialism <B> in <B> greece <B>
then <B> to <B> <unk> <I> his <B> credibility <I> with <B> the <B> left <B> he <B> <unk> <B> some <B> smaller <I> leftist <I> parties <I> to <B> stand <I> for <B> election <B> under <B> the <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O>

for <B> balance <B> and <O> in <B> hopes <B> of <B> gaining <B> some <B> <unk> <O> <unk> <O> votes <B> he <B> managed <B> to <I> attract <I> a <B> former <I> new <I> democracy <I> party <I> representative <I> and <I> known <I> political <I> enemy <I> of <B> mr. <B> <unk> <O>
