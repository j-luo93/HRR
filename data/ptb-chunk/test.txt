beginning <B> in <B> the <B> early <I> 19th <I> century <I> , <O> with <B> u.s. <B> v. <B> hudson <B> and <I> goodwin <I> , <O> the <B> supreme <I> court <I> has <B> repeatedly <I> held <I> that <B> a <B> judicial <I> power <I> to <B> declare <I> conduct <B> to <B> be <I> against <B> the <B> public <I> interest <I> and <O> hence <B> criminal <B> , <O> while <B> well <B> established <I> in <B> british <B> law <I> , <O> would <B> usurp <I> legislative <B> authority <I> under <B> the <B> doctrine <I> of <B> separation <B> of <B> powers <B> . <O>

for <B> example <B> , <O> although <B> insider <B> trading <I> has <B> long <I> been <I> criminal <B> , <O> it <B> has <B> never <I> been <I> statutorily <I> defined <I> . <O>
in <B> 1983 <B> , <O> the <B> supreme <I> court <I> tried <B> to <I> supply <I> a <B> workable <I> definition <I> in <B> the <O> dirks <O> v. <B> sec <B> decision <B> , <O> which <B> found <B> that <O> liability <B> depended <B> on <B> whether <B> the <B> tipper <I> had <B> breached <I> his <B> fiduciary <I> duty <I> to <B> the <B> corporation <I> in <B> order <O> to <B> obtain <I> `` <O> some <B> personal <I> gain <I> '' <O> and <O> whether <B> the <B> tippee <I> knew <B> or <O> recklessly <B> disregarded <I> this <B> fact <I> . <O>

consider <B> the <B> facts <I> underlying <B> the <B> 1989 <I> conviction <I> of <B> robert <B> chestman <I> . <O>
prior <B> to <B> a <B> tender <I> offer <I> by <B> a&p <B> for <B> waldbaum <B> inc. <I> in <B> 1986 <B> , <O> the <B> founder <I> of <B> the <B> waldbaum <I> 's <B> supermarket <I> chain <I> called <B> an <B> elderly <I> relative <I> to <B> tell <I> her <B> to <B> assemble <I> her <B> stock <I> certificates <I> for <B> delivery <B> . <O>

hearing <B> of <B> this <B> information <I> , <O> the <B> husband <I> discussed <B> it <B> with <B> his <B> broker <I> , <O> mr. <B> chestman <I> , <O> and <O> mr. <B> chestman <I> then <B> bought <B> for <B> his <B> own <I> account <I> and <O> other <B> clients <I> . <O>
basically <B> , <O> mr. <B> chestman <I> was <B> a <B> fourth-level <I> tippee <I> . <O>
did <O> mr. <B> loeb <I> , <O> his <B> tipper <I> , <O> breach <B> a <B> fiduciary <I> duty <I> -lrb- <O> and <O> , <O> if <B> so <B> , <O> to <B> whom <B> -rrb- <O> ? <O>

the <B> line <I> seems <B> awfully <B> thin <I> for <B> criminal-law <B> purposes <I> . <O>
a <B> second <I> illustration <I> is <B> supplied <I> by <B> the <B> recent <I> guilty <I> plea <I> entered <B> by <B> robert <B> freeman <I> , <O> formerly <B> head <B> of <B> arbitrage <B> at <B> goldman <B> , <I> sachs <I> & <I> co <I> . <O>
essentially <B> , <O> mr. <B> freeman <I> had <B> invested <I> heavily <B> in <B> the <B> beatrice <I> leveraged <I> buy-out <I> , <O> when <B> he <B> was <B> told <I> by <B> another <B> prominent <I> trader <I> , <O> bernard <B> `` <I> bunny <I> '' <I> lasker <I> , <O> that <B> the <B> deal <I> was <B> in <B> trouble <B> . <O>
after <B> placing <B> orders <B> to <B> sell <I> , <O> mr. <B> freeman <I> called <B> martin <B> siegel <I> , <O> an <B> investment <I> banker <I> at <B> kidder <B> , <I> peabody <I> & <I> co. <I> , <O> who <B> was <B> advising <I> on <B> the <B> deal <I> , <O> to <B> confirm <I> these <B> rumors <I> . <O>
mr. <B> siegel <I> asked <B> mr. <B> freeman <I> who <B> his <B> source <I> was <B> and <O> , <O> on <B> hearing <B> that <B> it <B> was <B> bunny <B> lasker <I> , <B> responded <I> : <O> `` <O> well <B> , <O> your <B> bunny <I> has <B> a <B> good <I> nose <I> . <O> '' <O>
the <B> illegal <I> `` <I> tip <I> '' <O> of <B> the <B> bunny <I> 's <B> good <I> nose <I> was <B> then <B> largely <B> a <B> confirmation <I> of <B> rumors <B> already <B> known <I> to <B> many <B> in <B> the <B> market <I> . <O>
had <O> the <B> case <I> gone <B> to <B> trial <B> the <B> same <I> issues <I> would <B> have <I> surfaced <I> : <O>
was <O> there <B> a <B> fiduciary <I> breach <I> in <B> order <O> to <B> obtain <I> personal <B> gain <I> ? <O>
did <O> mr. <B> freeman <I> have <B> notice <B> of <B> this <B> ? <O>
finally <B> , <O> was <O> the <B> information <I> material <B> ? <O>
yet <B> , <O> all <B> these <I> issues <I> are <B> subsidiary <B> to <B> a <B> more <I> central <I> issue <I> : <O> who <B> is <B> and <O> who <B> should <B> be <I> making <B> the <B> criminal <I> law <I> here <B> ? <O>
it <B> is <B> not <O> my <B> contention <I> that <B> either <B> mr. <B> chestman <I> or <O> mr. <B> freeman <I> was <B> an <B> innocent <I> victim <I> of <B> prosecutorial <B> overzealousness <I> . <O>
arguably <B> , <O> both <B> were <B> on <B> notice <B> that <B> their <B> behavior <I> was <B> at <B> least <I> risky <I> . <O>
but <O> even <B> if <I> they <B> behaved <B> recklessly <B> , <O> reasons <B> still <B> exist <B> to <I> fear <I> and <I> resist <I> this <B> steady <I> process <I> of <B> case-by-case <B> judicial <I> extension <I> of <B> the <B> law <I> of <B> insider <B> trading <I> . <O>
courts <B> and <I> legislatures <I> make <B> decisions <B> in <B> very <B> different <I> ways <I> and <O> are <B> each <O> susceptible <B> to <B> very <B> different <I> kinds <I> of <B> errors <B> . <O>
after-the-fact <B> judicial <I> examination <I> of <B> an <B> actor <I> 's <B> conduct <I> has <B> always <I> been <I> the <B> common <I> law <I> 's <B> method <I> . <O>
when <B> only <B> civil <I> liability <I> is <B> involved <I> , <O> this <B> method <I> has <B> the <B> undeniable <I> strengths <I> of <B> factual <B> specificity <I> and <O> avoidance <B> of <B> overgeneralization <B> . <O>
still <B> , <O> case-by-case <B> retrospective <I> decision <I> making <I> of <B> this <B> sort <I> is <B> vulnerable <B> to <B> the <B> tunnel <I> vision <I> caused <B> by <B> a <B> fixation <I> on <B> ad <O> hoc <O> -lrb- <O> and <O> usually <B> sleazy <I> -rrb- <O> examples <B> . <O>
when <B> a <B> court <I> decides <B> that <B> a <B> particular <I> actor <I> 's <B> conduct <I> was <B> culpable <B> and <O> so <B> extends <B> the <B> definition <I> of <B> insider <B> trading <I> to <B> reach <I> this <B> conduct <I> , <O> it <B> does <B> not <I> see <I> the <B> potentially <I> enormous <I> number <I> of <B> other <B> cases <I> that <B> will <B> be <I> covered <I> by <B> the <B> expanded <I> rule <I> . <O>
thus <B> , <O> a <B> court <I> is <B> poorly <B> positioned <I> to <B> make <I> judgments <B> about <B> the <B> social <I> utility <I> of <B> the <B> expanded <I> rule <I> . <O>

in <B> the <B> past <I> , <O> not <O> only <B> would <O> reputable <B> professionals <I> have <B> rushed <I> to <I> check <I> out <B> such <B> rumors <I> with <B> the <B> company <I> , <O> but <O> companies <B> listed <B> on <B> the <B> major <I> stock <I> exchanges <I> were <B> encouraged <I> by <B> the <B> exchanges <I> to <B> respond <I> openly <B> to <B> such <B> inquiries <I> from <B> securities <B> analysts <I> . <O>
today <B> , <O> after <B> mr. <B> freeman <I> 's <B> plea <I> , <O> there <B> is <B> an <B> uncertainty <I> that <B> is <B> both <B> unfair <I> and <I> inefficient <I> . <O>
in <B> this <B> light <I> , <O> the <B> comparative <I> advantages <I> of <B> legislative <B> law-making <I> become <B> clear <B> : <O> -lrb- <B> 1 <I> -rrb- <O> before <B> it <B> acts <B> , <O> the <B> legislature <I> typically <B> will <I> hear <I> the <B> views <I> of <B> representatives <B> of <B> all <B> those <I> affected <B> by <B> its <B> decision <I> , <B> not <I> just <B> the <I> immediate <I> parties <I> before <B> the <B> court <I> ; <O> and <O> -lrb- <B> 2 <I> -rrb- <O> the <B> legislature <I> can <B> frame <I> `` <B> bright <I> line <I> '' <I> standards <I> that <B> create <B> less <B> uncertainty <I> than <B> the <B> fact-bound <I> decisions <I> of <B> courts <B> . <O>

at <B> least <B> when <B> the <B> stakes <I> are <B> high <B> , <O> uncertainty <B> in <B> turn <B> results <B> in <B> overinclusion <B> , <O> as <B> individuals <B> do <B> not <I> dare <I> to <I> approach <I> an <B> uncertain <I> line <I> closely <B> . <O>
the <B> federal <I> mail <I> and <I> wire <I> fraud <I> statutes <I> provide <B> even <B> better <I> illustrations <I> of <B> the <B> rapid <I> evolution <I> of <B> a <B> federal <I> common <I> law <I> of <B> white-collar <B> crime <I> . <O>
in <B> 1987 <B> , <O> the <B> supreme <I> court <I> attempted <B> in <B> mcnally <B> v. <B> u.s. <B> to <B> halt <I> the <B> inexorable <I> expansion <I> of <B> these <B> statutes <I> by <B> adopting <B> a <B> rule <I> of <B> strict <B> construction <I> for <B> ambiguous <B> criminal <I> statues <I> . <O>
