if <B> all <B> you <B> want <B> is <B> death-benefit <B> coverage <I> , <O> pure <B> insurance <I> -- <O> a <B> term <I> policy <I> -- <O> gives <B> you <B> maximum <B> bang <I> for <B> your <B> buck <I> , <O> within <B> limits <B> . <O>
it <B> 's <B> much <B> cheaper <I> than <B> permanent <B> insurance <I> bought <B> at <B> the <B> same <I> age <I> . <O>
but <O> `` <O> term <B> '' <O> means <B> just <B> that <I> ; <O> the <B> policy <I> is <B> written <I> for <B> a <B> specific <I> time <I> period <I> only <I> and <O> must <B> be <I> renewed <I> when <B> it <B> expires <B> . <O>

sounds <B> great <B> -- <O> or <O> does <O> it <B> ? <O>
first <B> , <O> if <B> i <B> canceled <B> , <O> i <B> 'd <B> have <I> no <B> more <I> insurance <I> , <O> a <B> not <I> insignificant <I> consideration <I> . <O>
second <B> , <O> the <B> $ <I> 5,760 <I> i <B> 'd <B> get <I> back <B> would <B> be <I> much <I> diminished <I> in <B> purchasing <B> power <I> by <B> 10 <B> years <I> of <B> inflation <B> ; <O> amex <B> , <I> not <I> i <I> , <O> would <B> get <I> the <B> benefit <I> of <B> the <B> investment <I> income <I> on <B> my <B> money <I> , <O> income <B> that <B> would <B> have <I> exceeded <I> the <B> inflation <I> rate <I> and <O> thus <B> given <B> the <B> company <I> a <B> real <I> profit <I> . <O>
third <B> and <O> most <B> important <I> , <O> amex <B> would <B> charge <I> me <B> a <B> far <I> higher <I> premium <I> than <B> other <B> reputable <I> companies <I> would <B> on <B> a <B> straight <I> term <I> policy <I> for <B> the <B> same <I> amount <I> ; <O> i <B> 'd <B> be <I> paying <I> so <B> heavily <I> just <B> to <B> have <I> the <B> option <I> of <B> getting <B> my <B> premiums <I> back <B> that <B> i <B> 'd <B> almost <I> have <I> to <I> cancel <I> to <B> make <I> the <B> whole <I> thing <I> worthwhile <B> . <O>
that <B> would <B> be <I> all <B> right <I> with <B> amex <B> , <O> which <B> could <B> then <I> lock <I> in <B> its <B> investment <I> profit <I> , <O> but <O> it <B> does <B> n't <I> add <I> up <B> to <B> a <B> `` <I> smart <I> money <I> '' <I> move <I> for <B> me <B> . <O>
which <B> goes <B> to <I> show <I> that <B> the <B> first <I> law <I> applies <B> in <B> insurance <B> as <B> in <B> anything <B> else <B> : <O> there <B> is <B> no <B> free <I> lunch <I> , <O> there <B> is <B> only <B> marketing <I> . <O>

this <B> is <B> worth <B> remembering <B> when <B> insurers <B> and <O> their <B> salesmen <I> try <B> to <I> sell <I> you <B> permanent <B> insurance <I> , <O> the <B> kind <I> that <B> amasses <B> cash <B> value <I> . <O>
the <B> word <I> `` <I> death <I> '' <O> can <B> not <I> be <I> escaped <I> entirely <B> by <B> the <B> industry <I> , <O> but <O> salesmen <B> dodge <B> it <B> wherever <B> possible <B> or <O> cloak <B> it <B> in <B> euphemisms <B> , <O> preferring <B> to <I> talk <I> about <B> `` <B> savings <I> '' <I> and <I> `` <I> investment <I> '' <O> instead <B> . <O>
the <B> implication <I> is <B> that <O> your <B> permanent-insurance <I> policy <I> is <B> really <B> some <B> kind <I> of <B> cd <B> or <O> mutual-fund <B> account <I> with <B> an <B> added <I> feature <I> . <O>
that <B> is <B> gilding <B> the <B> lily <I> . <O>
the <B> fact <I> is <B> that <B> as <B> a <B> savings <I> or <I> investment <I> vehicle <I> , <O> insurance <B> generally <B> runs <B> a <B> poor <I> second <I> to <B> any <B> direct <I> investment <I> you <B> might <B> make <I> in <B> the <B> same <I> things <I> the <B> insurance <I> company <I> is <B> putting <I> your <B> money <I> into <B> . <O>

early <B> in <B> the <B> decade <I> he <B> saw <B> that <B> fur <B> workers <I> in <B> many <B> foreign <I> countries <I> were <B> willing <B> to <B> work <I> longer <B> hours <I> at <B> lower <B> wages <I> than <B> their <B> american <I> counterparts <I> and <O> were <B> more <B> open <I> to <B> innovation <B> . <O>

two <B> years <I> later <B> , <O> he <B> opened <B> one <B> in <B> west <B> germany <I> . <O>

on <B> oct. <B> 3 <I> , <O> following <B> conversations <B> with <B> secretary <O> of <B> state <B> james <B> baker <I> , <O> soviet <B> foreign <I> minister <I> eduard <I> shevardnadze <I> arrived <B> in <B> managua <B> to <B> acclaim <I> `` <O> nicaragua <B> 's <B> great <I> peace <I> efforts <I> . <O> '' <O>
there <B> , <O> mr. <B> shevardnadze <I> felt <B> legitimized <I> to <I> unveil <I> his <B> own <I> peace <I> plan <I> : <O> the <B> u.s.s.r. <I> would <B> prolong <I> a <B> suspension <I> of <B> arms <B> shipments <I> to <B> nicaragua <B> after <B> the <B> february <I> election <I> if <B> the <B> u.s. <I> did <B> likewise <B> with <B> its <B> allies <I> in <B> central <B> america <I> . <O>

since <B> mr. <B> shevardnadze <I> 's <B> proposals <I> followed <B> discussions <B> with <B> mr. <B> baker <I> , <O> speculations <B> arose <B> that <B> the <B> bush <I> administration <I> was <B> seeking <I> an <B> accommodation <I> with <B> the <B> soviets <I> in <B> central <B> america <I> . <O>

the <B> sad <I> condition <I> of <B> u.s. <B> policy <I> in <B> central <B> america <I> is <B> best <I> depicted <I> by <B> the <B> recent <I> end <I> to <B> u.s. <B> sponsorship <I> of <B> radio <B> costa <I> rica <I> . <O>
in <B> 1984 <B> , <O> the <B> costa <I> rican <I> government <I> requested <B> help <B> to <B> establish <I> a <B> radio <I> station <I> in <B> the <B> northern <I> part <I> of <B> the <B> country <I> , <O> flooded <B> by <B> airwaves <B> of <B> sandinista <B> propaganda <I> . <O>

according <B> to <B> news <B> reports <I> , <O> the <B> abrupt <I> termination <I> was <B> due <B> to <B> fears <B> that <B> voa <B> transmissions <I> could <B> interfere <I> with <B> the <B> peace <I> process <I> . <O>
in <B> the <B> meantime <I> , <O> russia <B> gave <B> nicaragua <B> another <B> powerful <I> radio <I> transmitter <I> , <O> which <B> has <B> been <I> installed <I> in <B> the <B> city <I> of <B> esteli <B> . <O>

finally <B> , <O> the <B> theory <I> suggests <B> why <B> republicans <B> generally <B> have <B> fared <I> better <B> in <B> senate <B> races <I> than <B> in <B> campaigns <B> for <B> the <B> house <I> . <O>

to <B> the <B> extent <I> that <B> the <B> primary <I> duty <I> of <B> personal <B> staff <I> involves <B> local <B> benefit-seeking <I> , <O> this <B> indicates <B> that <B> political <B> philosophy <I> leads <B> congressional <B> republicans <I> to <B> pay <I> less <B> attention <I> to <B> narrow <B> constituent <I> concerns <I> . <O>
second <B> , <O> if <B> the <B> key <I> assumption <I> is <B> valid <B> , <O> democrats <B> should <B> have <I> lower <B> attendance <I> rates <I> on <B> roll-call <B> votes <I> than <B> republicans <B> do <B> to <B> the <B> extent <I> that <B> such <B> votes <I> reflect <B> national <B> policy <I> making <I> and <O> that <B> participating <B> in <B> such <B> votes <I> takes <B> away <B> from <B> the <B> time <I> a <B> legislator <I> could <B> otherwise <I> devote <I> to <B> local <B> benefit-seeking <I> . <O>

now <B> that <B> vietnam <B> appears <B> to <I> have <I> pulled <I> out <B> its <B> occupation <I> army <I> , <O> the <B> state <I> department <I> is <B> talking <I> again <B> about <B> accepting <B> an <B> `` <I> interim <I> '' <I> coalition <I> government <I> in <B> the <B> cambodian <I> capital <I> of <B> phnom <B> penh <I> . <O>
the <B> coalition <I> would <B> include <I> the <B> current <I> vietnamese-backed <I> hun <I> sen <I> regime <I> , <O> the <B> two <I> non-communist <I> resistance <I> groups <I> led <B> by <B> son <B> sann <I> and <O> prince <B> sihanouk <I> , <O> and <O> the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> . <O>
the <B> aim <I> would <B> be <I> to <B> end <I> the <B> guerrilla <I> war <I> for <B> control <B> of <B> cambodia <B> by <B> allowing <B> the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> a <B> small <I> share <I> of <B> power <B> . <O>
the <B> state <I> department <I> says <B> that <B> any <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> participation <I> would <B> have <I> to <I> be <I> `` <O> minimal <B> . <O> '' <O>
the <B> usual <I> problem <I> with <B> including <B> communists <B> in <B> `` <B> interim <I> '' <I> coalition <I> governments <I> is <B> that <B> their <B> ideology <I> and <I> methods <I> require <B> they <B> squeeze <B> out <B> everyone <B> else <B> . <O>
recall <B> that <B> nicaragua <B> 's <B> sandinistas <I> came <B> into <B> managua <B> as <B> partners <B> in <B> a <B> coalition <I> government <I> with <B> anti-somoza <B> moderates <I> . <O>

even <O> mao <B> tse-tung <I> 's <B> china <I> began <B> in <B> 1949 <B> with <B> a <B> partnership <I> between <B> the <B> communists <I> and <O> a <B> number <I> of <B> smaller <B> , <I> non-communist <I> parties <I> . <O>
what <B> complicates <B> the <B> scene <I> in <B> cambodia <B> is <B> that <B> the <B> current <I> regime <I> is <B> already <B> communist <B> , <O> as <B> are <B> its <B> vietnamese <I> overseers <I> back <B> in <I> hanoi <B> , <O> as <B> are <B> the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> -- <O> who <B> are <B> the <B> strongest <I> of <B> the <B> three <I> guerrilla <I> groups <I> . <O>

that <B> would <B> leave <I> hun <B> sen <I> and <O> the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> . <O>
the <B> hun <I> sen <I> regime <I> has <B> sent <I> thousands <B> of <B> conscript <B> laborers <I> to <B> die <I> of <B> malaria <B> and <I> malnourishment <I> while <B> building <B> cambodia <B> 's <B> equivalent <I> of <B> the <B> berlin <I> wall <I> near <B> the <B> thai <I> border <I> . <O>
the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> , <O> however <B> , <O> carry <B> an <B> unsurpassed <I> record <I> for <B> cambodian <B> tyranny <I> . <O>

the <B> cambodian <I> horror <I> was <B> so <B> bad <I> that <B> the <B> vietnamese <I> occupation <I> in <B> 1978 <B> was <B> a <B> perverse <I> form <I> of <B> relief <B> . <O>
the <B> world <I> might <B> want <I> to <I> believe <I> that <B> the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> ca <B> n't <I> still <I> be <I> such <B> bad <I> guys <I> , <O> just <B> as <I> in <B> the <B> late <I> 1970s <I> it <B> was <B> reluctant <B> to <B> credit <I> the <B> reports <I> of <B> genocide <B> then <B> taking <I> place <B> . <O>
but <O> there <B> is <B> no <B> solid <I> evidence <I> that <B> the <B> khmer <I> rouge <I> have <B> changed <I> . <O>

it <B> 's <B> time <B> the <B> state <I> department <I> recognized <B> that <B> china <B> does <B> not <I> play <I> by <B> gentlemen <B> 's <B> rules <I> . <O>

it <B> would <B> be <I> entirely <B> rational <I> for <B> communist <B> insurgents <I> in <B> countries <B> such <B> as <I> the <B> philippines <I> or <O> peru <B> to <B> conclude <I> the <B> following <I> : <O> fight <B> viciously <B> enough <I> and <O> the <B> u.s. <I> , <O> under <B> the <B> banner <I> of <B> pragmatism <B> , <O> might <B> eventually <I> help <I> negotiate <I> your <B> way <I> to <B> victory <B> . <O>

part <B> of <B> the <B> answer <I> lies <B> in <B> the <B> nature <I> of <B> the <B> industry <I> . <O>
many <B> larger <I> egg <I> producers <I> are <B> also <B> egg <B> processors <I> , <O> who <B> crack <B> , <I> inspect <I> , <I> and <I> sanitize <I> billions <B> of <B> eggs <B> , <O> turning <B> them <B> into <B> powdered <B> , <I> liquified <I> or <I> frozen <I> egg <I> products <I> . <O>

but <O> for <B> companies <B> that <B> use <B> hundreds <B> of <B> eggs <B> a <B> day <I> , <O> breaking <B> them <B> by <B> hand <B> can <B> get <I> , <O> well <B> , <O> out <B> of <B> hand <B> . <O>
the <B> idea <I> behind <B> the <B> egg <I> king <I> is <B> pretty <B> simple <I> : <O> put <B> the <B> eggs <I> into <B> a <B> cylinder <I> that <B> contains <B> perforated <B> baskets <I> , <O> spin <B> them <B> at <B> a <B> high <I> speed <I> to <B> break <I> the <B> shells <I> and <O> strain <B> the <B> edible <I> part <I> through <B> the <B> baskets <I> . <O>
one <B> egg <I> king <I> -- <O> which <B> at <B> just <B> under <I> four <B> feet <I> tall <B> and <O> two <B> feet <I> wide <B> has <B> been <I> likened <I> to <B> the <B> robot <I> r2-d2 <B> -- <O> can <B> crack <I> about <B> 20,000 <I> eggs <I> an <B> hour <I> . <O>
because <B> fresh <B> eggs <I> are <B> less <B> expensive <I> than <B> processed <B> ones <I> , <O> a <B> big <I> egg <I> user <I> can <B> recover <I> the <B> egg <I> king <I> 's <B> $ <B> 3,390 <O> cost <B> in <B> a <B> few <I> months <I> , <O> says <B> mr. <B> maynard <I> . <O>
such <B> centrifugal <I> egg <I> breakers <I> have <B> been <I> around <B> since <B> the <B> 1890s <I> . <O>
but <O> when <B> mr. <B> maynard <I> came <B> forward <B> with <B> his <B> machine <I> in <B> the <B> early <I> 1970s <I> nobody <B> else <B> was <B> offering <I> them <B> in <B> the <B> u.s. <I> . <O>
the <B> main <I> reason <I> : <O> salmonella <B> . <O>
chickens <B> carry <B> this <B> bacteria <I> , <O> which <B> can <B> cause <I> upset <B> stomachs <I> and <O> , <O> in <B> rare <B> cases <I> , <O> death <B> among <B> people <B> . <O>
hens <B> sometimes <B> pass <B> salmonella <B> to <B> the <B> eggs <I> , <O> and <O> it <B> can <B> also <I> be <I> found <I> on <B> unclean <B> shells <I> . <O>
thus <B> , <O> any <B> machine <I> that <B> breaks <B> large <B> amounts <I> of <B> eggs <B> at <B> once <I> has <B> the <B> potential <I> to <B> spread <I> salmonella <B> if <B> a <B> bad <I> egg <I> gets <B> in <B> with <B> the <B> good <I> ones <I> . <O>
mr. <B> maynard <I> claims <B> this <B> is <B> a <B> manageable <I> problem <I> . <O>
the <B> egg <I> king <I> carries <B> written <B> instructions <I> to <B> break <I> only <B> high-grade <I> eggs <I> that <B> have <B> been <I> properly <I> sanitized <I> and <O> , <O> as <B> an <B> added <I> precaution <I> , <B> to <I> use <B> the <B> eggs <I> only <B> in <B> products <B> that <B> will <B> be <I> cooked <I> enough <B> to <B> kill <I> bacteria <B> . <O>
